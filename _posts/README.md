### 🎄🪅 diary of December 5th
&emsp;&emsp;Recently, I'm reading about the article of a paper printed by IEEE, [《Foudations of dynamic BFT》](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9833787) which studies the dynamic BFT problem through a new view.   
&emsp;&emsp;First of all, here are some materials about BFT(byzantine fault tolerance), with the [definition in Wekipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault)

&emsp;&emsp;To complete my final work of blockchain course, i'm gonna update my reading diary daily and represent my translation and reading notes.Let's study together!

&emsp;&emsp;After reading the para below, i started to study the [**Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance**](https://www.cnblogs.com/peteremperor/p/15545155.html) to find out the **view** in BFT   
> Our notion of configurations (dealing with membership) is independent of views (in the sense of view changes for partially synchronous BFT)
